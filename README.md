To complete this problem set we programmed several heuristics for the [MIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominating_set) (Minimun Independent Dominating Set) problem. We then conducted some experimentation to see the rate of convergence of the heuristics and to calibrate the different parameters used in [GRASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_randomized_adaptive_search_procedure) (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure).
